Python-Projects

These are th projects I worked on:

* Tip Calculator
  - This is a simple calculator that can be used if you are splitting the bill with a couple of people and want to find the total amount (includes the tip). 

* BMI Calculator
  - This is a calculator that can be used to find a person's BMI based on their height (m) and weight (kg).
